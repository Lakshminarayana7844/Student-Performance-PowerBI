 Student Performance Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

 Overview
This project analyzes the *Students Performance in Exams* dataset from Kaggle.  
The goal is to explore how background factors such as parental education, lunch type, and test preparation affect student results in Math, Reading, and Writing.

 Objectives
- Identify factors influencing student performance  
- Compare subject-wise averages  
- Visualize the effect of preparation and socio-economic background  
- Create an interactive Power BI dashboard  

 Dataset
